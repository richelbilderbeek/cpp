======================================================

 

[Boost.Statechart](CppStatechart.md) is a [Boost](CppBoost.md)
[library](CppLibrary.md) for finite state machines.

 

As far as I know, the difference between [Boost.Graph](CppGraph.md) and
[Boost.Statechart](CppStatechart.md) is that
[Boost.Statechart](CppStatechart.md) allows the programmer to determine
a finite state machine at compile-time, where
[Boost.Graph](CppGraph.md) allows this at run-time.
